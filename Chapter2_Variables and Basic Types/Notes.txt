1. Primitive built-in types
	signed & unsigned

	use double over float, use int over long

	If we assign an out-of-range value to an object of signed type, the result is undefined.

	signed will automatically converted to unsigned

	escape sequence

2. Variables
	Declaration and definition
		Recommend initializing every object of built-in type.

	Scope of the variables

	Reference
		An alias to the variable, point to the variable.

		Must be initialized.

		There is no way to rebind the reference with another variable

		Have no address, just refer to the object

	Pointer
		Like references, pointers are used for indirect access to other objects. Unlike a reference, a pointer is an object in its own right.

		A pointer holds the address of another object. We get the address of an object by usin the address-of operator (the & operator)

		A pointer holds the address of another object. We get the address of an object by usin the address-of operator.

		Dereference a ppinter yields the object to which the pointer points.
